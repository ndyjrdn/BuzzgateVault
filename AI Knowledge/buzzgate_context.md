### üè† **Smart Home Ecosystem: Buzzgate**

- **Core Goals:**
    
    - Fully local, customizable automation
        
    - Zigbee/Matter mesh reliability
        
    - Scene-based lighting and media control
        
    - Family-friendly access and emergency alerting
        
    - Monitoring + alerting for uptime, WAN speed, zombie processes, etc.
    - 
    ##  Buzzgate Context

Buzzgate is a fully local smart home ecosystem built on Zigbee 3.0, MQTT, and modular YAML automations. It uses a Beelink mini PC ("Brain") to orchestrate containers for monitoring, alerting, and scene control. Key components include:

- Zigbee2MQTT with TubeZB coordinator
- Mosquitto MQTT broker
- Home Assistant with custom scenes and automations
- Glances for system vitals (CPU, memory, disk, zombie processes)
- Grafana + InfluxDB for WAN speed and time-series monitoring
- Alertmanager for modular notifications (Pushover preferred)
- NAS-mounted volumes for persistent memory and media
- Git-backed Obsidian vault for logs, planning, and scene design

Naming conventions follow a Cyclone-themed schema (e.g. `cy-ai`, `BuzzgateVault`, `Skippy`, `Brain`). YAML workflows are modular, versioned, and designed for maintainability.

Recent upgrades include:
- Migration from MariaDB to InfluxDB for monitoring
- Scene refactors for mesh reliability
- Integration of Nextcloud calendars with Home Assistant
        
- **Key Components:**
    
    - **Brain:** Beelink mini PC running Docker containers
        
    - **BuzzgateVault:** Git-backed Obsidian vault for project tracking
        
    - **Buzzgate Monitor:** Grafana + InfluxDB + Glances + Alertmanager
        
    - **Lighting Grid:** Zigbee2MQTT with TubeZB coordinator
        
    - **Media:** Jellyfin integration, retro gaming setups, calendar modding
