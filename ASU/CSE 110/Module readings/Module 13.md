## 14.1 Choosing classes to create
- ### Decomposing into classes

Creating a program may start by a programmer deciding what "things" exist, and what each thing contains and does.

 ## 14.2 Classes and ArrayLists
 ### ArrayList of objects: A reviews program

A programmer commonly uses classes and ArrayLists together.

### A class with an ArrayList: The Reviews class

A class can also involve ArrayLists.  creating a Reviews class for managing an ArrayList of Review objects.


      currRating = scnr.nextInt();
## 14.3 ArrayList ADT
- review of .get .add .remove etc from ArrayList

## 14.4 Parameters or reference types
for reference variables if the var1=var2 sets them to the same reference rather than duplicating so this doesn't create a new object.  Just multiple references to the same object

**THIS**

## 14.5 Static fields and methods
- instance members are object specfic
- Static members are shared by all objects of a class
	- Data or methods
- Static method like Math.sqrt() - don't have to declare a Math object

## 14.6 Mechanics of classes
An object and the variable that refers to it are two different things.

Life cycle of a Bunny Object:
```java
class Bunny {
 public String name = "";
     public int age = 0;
     public Bunny() { // a default constructor that does nothing
     }
     public Bunny(String name, int age) {
         this.name = name;
         this.age = age;
     }
     public void hop() {
         System.out.print(this.age + " year old " + this.name);
         System.out.println(" hops around.");
    }
 }
 public class Main {
     public static void main(String []args) {
         Bunny flopsy = new Bunny("Flopsy", 8);
         flopsy.hop();
     }
 }
```

The life cycle of the Bunny object that will be created and used in the above code example is composed of six steps:

1. Instantiation
2. Initialization
3. Construction
4. Assignment
5. Use
6. Destruction

## 14.7 Using packages
A package is a grouping of related types, classes, interfaces, and subpackage. The types, classes, and interfaces in a package are called package members. The following table lists several built-in Java packages and sample package members.
