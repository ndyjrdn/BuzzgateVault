## 11.1 What are value types
- There are 2 types in java:
	- Value types
	- Reference types
- All primitive types are value types
- Value types variables always store a value of that type
- Assignment statement stores a value in the variable.
	- only 1 per value type
	- when a new value is assigned it replaces the former
	- 
	## 11.2 Value Type assignment
	1. A variable is a name that refers to a location in computer memory where a value is stored.
	2. A value type variable stores a value of that type.
	3. An assignment statement stores a value in a variable.
## 11.3 What are reference types
- all non-primitive types are reference types
- ==A variable of a non-primitive type must store a reference to an object of that type, or the special null reference. A variable of type Scanner always stores a reference to a Scanner object, or it stores a null reference. A null reference means that the variable does not refer to any object at this time.==
-  : Reference types can store a reference to a variable of that type OR null
