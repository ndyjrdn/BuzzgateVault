- ==Every program ever written is composed of just these 3 structures==
- We can stack them
- Nest them
- Replace them

- in a program a branch is a sequence only executed under certain condition
- An if-else can be extended to an if-elseif-else structure. Each branch's expression is checked in sequence; as soon as one branch's expression is found to be true, that branch is taken. If no expression is found true, execution will reach the else branch, which then executes.
