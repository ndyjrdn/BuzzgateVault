## 6.1 What is a Method

ðŸš©a program can be viewed as a package or responsibilities
- 2 forms of responsibilities
	-  Things the program must know and remember or keep track of **VARIABLES**
	- Things the package must do, instructions is must carry out. **METHODS**
	Variables - NOUNS
	Methods - VERBS

	==A method is a name that refers to a sequence of instructions in memory. Those instructions are executed when the method is called by its name.==
	==In much the same way that a variable allows us to name a value, a method allows us to name a sequence of instructions. Both make our programs easier to design, easier to write, easier to read, easier to test, easier to debug, and easier to maintain.==
	
	- the best way to get something done in a program is to call a method that does that thing
	- 
## 6.2 how to call a method
ðŸš©AÂ method callÂ has 2 major parts, theÂ ==method name==, and theÂ ==argument list==.
- argument lists are ALWAYS separated by commas

## 6.3 what are arguments
ðŸš©Arguments give methods what they need
- can be literals, variables, or expressions.  All evaluate to a value
- Arguments are evaluated to values before the method is called, the values are passed to the methods
