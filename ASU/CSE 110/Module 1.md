A computer 
	- Follows instructions
	- Remembers
	- Makes decisions
	- Can repeat

Computers run programs - That is all

A program:
- Contains instructions
- Is written in language a computer can read
- solves a problem

Instructions are stored in a memory. A memory is a circuit that can store 0s and 1s in each of a series of thousands of addressed locations, like a series of addressed mailboxes that each can store an envelope (the 0s and 1s). Instructions operate on data, which is also stored in memory locations as 0s and 1s.
## TLDR
- Computers are programmable machines
- A program is a set of instructions written in a language that a computer can execute to solve a problem


sequences of 0 and 1 are machine instructions and a sequence of machine instructions is an executable program (executable)

Compilers translate high-level language programs into executable programs

# 1.3
- input/output devices : keyboard, screen, touch screen etc
- Storage: disk that stores memory -non-volatile (stays even with power off)
- Memory: RAM (random access memory) volatile random ie can access any memory in ram anywhere in any order quickly
- BIOS - Basic input / output system
- Operating System allows a user to run other programs.
- processor (CPU or microprocessor (single chip))
- in processor RAM is called cache memory
- Clock - ticks at a specific frequency 1MHz = 1 million ticks/second 1GHz a billion ticks per second.   Executing about 1 instruction per clock tick, processors thus execute millions or billions of instructions per second.
- transistors are small switches
- Integrated circuit is a set of transistors on a chip
-  **Moore's law** IC capacity doubles about every 2 years

# 1.4
- An algorithm is a list of instructions that when followed solves a problem
	- Sequence: instructions in specific order top to bottom
	- Decision: if conditions are met, a different set of inst. are followed
	- iteration: instructions are repeated while  condition is met
	- Stacking: listing algorithm structures in sequential order
	- Pseudocode: an informal high level description of an algorithm intended for maximum human readability

The harder part of computer science and programming is designing and expressing the algorithm. The easier part is translating that algorithm into a programming language. The technique of using pseudocode allows us to separate these two things - designing and expressing the algorithm, and then translating (or implementing) that algorithm in a programming language - and therefore focus on one problem at a time. This is an example of what I believe is the most powerful ability in the computer scientists skill set - the ability to break complicated things down into two or more simpler things and then to better use our limited resources to solve each of these smaller simpler problems one at a time - in other words, to divide and conquer.

Flow charts show the process and help to focus on the details

that uses few words and simple symbols to make a process easier to understand.

A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time.
	Basic instructions:
	- input: a program gets data from a file, a keyboard, ets
	- Process: performs computations on the data
	- Output: puts the results of the process somewhere

# 1.6
In Java a 
- scanner object accepts input (from keyboard or elsewhere)
- System.in is the input to put in the scanner
- System.out.print prints in a continuous line
- System.out.println prints each instance on a separate line
- print text with "" and output variables values with no quotes
- '+' concatenates System.out.print().  Can include text and values
# 1.7
- Syntax the set of rules that define the structure of how statements are formed
- Semantics is the meaning of the statement
- java is general purpose and can run on any platform (windows, mac, mobile...)
- Class based and Object oriented
- Strongly typed.  This means we must declare variables and the remain the same type throughout
- Java is compiled and can run anywhere the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) exists

# 1.10
comments.  Single-line or multi-line (block comment)
Program ignores comments

Whitespace
- Use blank lines to separate conceptually distinct statements.
- Indent lines the same amount.
- Align items to reduce visual clutter.
- Use a single space before and after any operators like =, +, *, or / to make statements more readable

# 1.11
White space in output is important. 
Precision and focus

# 1.12
Errors and warnings
Syntax errors or compile time errors
Good practice for fixing errors reported by the compiler.

1. Focus on FIRST error message, ignoring the rest.
2. Look at reported line of first error message. If error found, fix. Else, look at previous few lines.
3. Compile, repeat.

Logic errors or run time errors (BUG)
code a few lines, compile, check, code, compile check ...
